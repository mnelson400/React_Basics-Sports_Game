// NORMAL MODE
// The Team Component:
// In order to play this game, you are going to need to create teams so 
// they can compete for the win. Below is an outline of the functionality 
// that our team component should include.
//  1. Create a stateful Team component that accepts 
//     a name and a path to a logo for the team as a prop.
//  2. This component should display the team name 
//     and the logo provided through props.
//  3. The Team component should also display some stats about the team.
//     A. It should display the number of Shots Taken.
//     B. It should display the Score for the team.
//  4. The Team component should have a Shoot button. We don't score 
//     every time we shoot so let's discuss the shoot buttons functionality.
//     A. When a shot is taken the Shots Taken count should always increase.
//     b. There should be a random chance that the Score counter increases.
//  5. Make sure to render and test your Team component functionality as you add new features.

// Setup our battle of the sports teams:
// Now that we have a Default component that represents our Application and we 
// have created our Team component, we can start assembling the game.
//  1. Update the default App component you created to display 2 teams, 
//     the home team and the visiting team.
//  2. Use your knowledge of HTML and CSS to make the page look more like 
//     a game where two teams, home and visiting, are facing off in competition.
//  3. Verify both teams are displayed and keeping track of their stats.

// MEDIUM MODE
// Let's add some extra functionality to our sports game:
//  1. Add functionality to make a sound play when a team shoots and a different 
//     sound when a team scores. The resources below should help accomplish this.
//     A. HTML audio element on MDN:
//        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement
//     B. Free sound effects:
//        https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/sports-10098/
//  2. Let's add an additonal statistic to our teams. Let's display a Shot Percentage 
//     metric. This should be shots attempted divided by shots scored.
//     A. This metric should only display if a shot has been taken. This should not 
//        be visible if the team has not attempted to make a shot.
//  3. Create a Game Component that accepts a venue name as a prop.
//  4. Update your default component that is currently displaying your teams to display 
//     the Game component instead. And move everything the default component was 
//     displaying into the Game component.
//  5. Update the Game component to display "Welcome to" followed by the name of 
//     the venue passed in as a prop.
//  6. Your app should still render the default component with ReactDOM.render(), 
//     commonly named App.
//     A. The default App component should only render the Game component instead 
//        of rendering the Team components as before.
//     B. The Game component should display the venue name for the game and the 
//        Team components that were previously displayed in the default App component.
//     C. Each team should function as before but now conditionally display a Shot 
//        Percentage metric if a shot has been taken by the team.
//  7. Think about what would happen if we added another Game component to our App. 
//     We could change the Venue name but we can only create new games with the 
//     same teams. What could we modify in the Game and Team components to allow 
//     us to have unique teams for each game we include in our default App component?
